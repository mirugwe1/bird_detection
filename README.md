# bird_detection
This repository hosts all the scripts used in the implementation of bird detection models. We are using Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN)'s Faster R-CNN, Single Shot Detector(SSD), and YOLOv3 meta-architectures while utilizing ResNet-101, MobileNet, Inception ResNet v2 and VGG-16 feature extraction Networks (backbone network).
